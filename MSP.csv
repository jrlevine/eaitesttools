EAI-MSP-001,Local part of address containing Unicode is accepted,The provider must allow the user to specify a Unicode value as the local part of the assigned address.,Register account with local part of address <Unicode>,Registration is successful,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-002,Domain part of address containing Unicode is accepted,"If the provider allows the user to specify a domain or subdomain part for their account’s assigned address, it must allow a Unicode (U-label) value to be provided as the domain or subdomain of the assigned address.",Register account with domain part of address <Unicode>,Registration is successful,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-003,Local part of address containing Unicode is displayed as entered,"The provider’s software interface should display the local parts of EAI addresses as Unicode. This applies to the input field through which the user enters their chosen address, as well as any time the generated address is displayed to the user thereafter.",Register account with local part of address <Unicode>,<Email> local part is displayed as Unicode,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-004,Domain part of address containing Unicode is displayed as entered,"The provider’s software interface should display the domain parts of EAI addresses in U-label form. This applies to the input field through which the user enters their chosen address, as well as any time the generated address is displayed to the user thereafter.",Register account with domain part of address <Unicode>,<Email> domain part is displayed in U-label form,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-005,Address with ASCII equivalent of local part containing Unicode is provided,"The provider should provision an ASCII-only equivalent of any address containing Unicode text in the local part, for use with legacy email systems. Exactly how the address is formed (for example by converting the non-ASCII local part to an ASCII-only version automatically, allowing the user to specify the alternative manually, and so on) and whether or not it is done automatically is not important for this test, just that a second, non-EAI address can be provided to the user.",Register account with local part of address <Unicode>,Registration is successful and ASCII address is provisioned,Advisory,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-006,Address with ASCII equivalent of domain part containing Unicode is provided,"If the provider allows the user to choose a domain or subdomain part for the assigned address, it should provision an ASCII-only (A-label) equivalent address of any address containing Unicode text in the domain part (for example, one with a Punycode-encoded version of the domain part) for use with legacy email systems. Exactly how the address is formed (for example by converting the non-ASCII domain to an ASCII-only version automatically, allowing the user to choose an alternative domain, and so on) and whether or not it is done automatically is not important for this test, just that a second, non-EAI address can be provided to the user.",Register account with domain part of address <Unicode>,Registration is successful and ASCII address is provisioned,Advisory,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-007,Mailbox name containing Unicode is accepted,"If the provider allows the user to create or rename mailboxes, it must accept mailbox names as Unicode text.",Create mailbox <Unicode>,Mailbox is created,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-008,Mailbox name containing Unicode is displayed as entered,"If the provider allows the user to create or rename mailboxes, its software interface must display mailbox names as Unicode.",Create mailbox <Unicode>,<Unicode> is displayed as Unicode,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-009,Address with local part containing Unicode receives messages,"The provider must correctly receive EAI messages at assigned addresses with Unicode in the local part of the address. This verifies that the provider can not only generate an account with an EAI address, but that it correctly handles mail destined for that address as well.",Send message to account with local part containing <Unicode>,Message is received,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-010,Address with domain part containing Unicode receives messages,"If the provider allows a user to specify a domain or subdomain part for the assigned address, then it must correctly receive EAI messages at that address. This verifies that the provider can not only generate an account with an EAI address, but that it correctly handles mail destined for that address as well.",Send message to account with domain part containing <Unicode>,Message is received,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-011,Address with local part containing Unicode sends messages,"The provider must correctly receive EAI messages at assigned addresses with Unicode in the local part of the address. This verifies that the provider can not only generate an account with an EAI address, but that it correctly handles mail sent by the user from that address as well. The test process should not only check that the provider’s mail server accepts the message and reports that it has been transmitted, but also ensure that it has been received at its destination address.",Send message from account with local part containing <Unicode>,Message is sent,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
EAI-MSP-012,Address with domain part containing Unicode sends messages,"If the provider allows a user to specify a domain or subdomain part for the assigned address, then it must correctly transmit EAI messages sent on behalf of the user from that address. This verifies that the provider can not only generate an account with an EAI address, but that it correctly handles mail sent by the user from that address as well. The test process should not only check that the provider’s mail server accepts the message and reports that it has been transmitted, but also ensure that it has been received at its destination address.",Send message from account with domain part containing <Unicode>,Message is sent,Required,2,"UASG 007, UASG 012"
